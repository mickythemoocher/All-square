<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> (Quite loudly) Hi Kay, I am over here.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">(After a short moment). Hello Anton, I thought I would be the first here.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> I have only just arrived, I haven't ordered yet.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">I am desperate for a coffee. I have had such a busy morning.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Sorry to hear that, mine has been quite relaxing.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">I had to visit the dentist.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh ouch!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes, I really hate going to the dentist.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Was it ok?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes, just a check-up fortunately, so no pain involved.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh good. <p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Look, Les has just come in. ( A little louder) Over here Les.<p>

<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">I know, too long. How are you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Very well thanks but I have had a busy morning.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Tell me about it. I have been rushed off my feet since I first got up. I could really do with a coffee now.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Me too.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton: </font color="#0000CC">Let's order some then. ( a little louder) Waiter?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> (after a short pause) Yes! Is there something you want?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> We'd like to order some coffee please.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh ok, what do you want?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Kay?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Cappuccino for me please.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Americano please<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton: </font color="#0000CC">Cappuccino too please<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">So one American and 3 cappuccino's <p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> No, only two cappuccino's<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">But it is one cappuccino for the lady and two for you.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> No, no. Just one for each of us.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> But you just said you wanted two.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> I meant the lady is having a Cappuccino and I would like one too, I would like one as well.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Ok, ok, let me scribble that out and start again. I have plenty of time, only a cafe full of customers to serve. One americano and two Cappuccino's. One each then?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Yes, thank you <p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Oh look! Bev has just come in â€“ Over here Bev.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> Just a moment waiter we may need to add to that order.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> No problem, let me just scribble this out again then.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">(A little out of breath) Hi everyone, sorry I am late.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> It's ok Bev, we haven't been here long. Do you want a coffee?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Oh yes please, cappuccino.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> So waiter, that is now three cappuccino's and one americano.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter. </font color="#0000CC">Ok, I got it. Still one each?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes, exactly.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Fine, you just sit there and chat then and I will rush off to make your coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Thank you.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Before I forget it again Kay, here is that five pounds that I owe you. <p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Oh don't worry about it Bev, I had almost forgotten it.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Don't be silly Kay, you were kind enough to lend it to me when I forgot my purse.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">We all do that sometimes.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Here you are, and thank you again.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Thank you Bev, that will pay for my coffee today.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">I hope she doesn't take too long with the coffee, I'm gasping.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Yes me too. Normally the first thing I do in the morning is to make coffee but I couldn't have one this morning as I had to visit the dentist.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh I hope it wasn't painful Kay.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">No just a check-up but I didn't want to have coffee breath.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">I don't blame you. I think everyone likes to have fresh breathe when the visit the dentist.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Here you are then. Four slices of lemon torte.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">What?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> I said, four slices of lemon torte.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">We heard what you said. We are just a little surprised as we didn't order any lemon torte.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">In fact, I don't even like lemon torte.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> So why did you order it then?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">We didn't order it. We ordered coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Did you? Let me check. Hmm da da da da, yes. The lemon torte is for those two people over there. You were the ones messing about with the coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> We weren't messing about with the coffee, we just tried to order some.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Whatever. Anyway I had better take this over to those two.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Four pieces of torte for two people?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, I don't ask questions, just get what people order.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">(quietly) Fingers crossed.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Are you sure you don't want them before I take them away?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Quite sure thank you. Just the coffee if you would be so kind.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Alright, alright, it's coming.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh silly me!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">What's wrong Kay?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Well here I was thinking that the five pounds Bev just gave me would pay for my coffee but I owe it to you Les.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Do you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC"> Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes, it was a while ago now but do you remember I asked you to bring me some cuttings from your garden and I would pay you for them?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Oh Kay, don't be silly you don't have to pay for them, treat them as a gift.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">No, I absolutely insist, you were kind enough to get them for me so you please take the five pounds.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC"> Ok. Thank you. But you really didn't need to.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">I wouldn't be able to ask you again if you don't let me pay. Here you are Les and thank you again.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Can you remind me again, was it three americano's and one cappuccino or the other way around?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Anton: (a little exasperated) The other way around. Three  cappuccino's and one americano.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Alright I forgot as you kept messing me about.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">We definitely did not mess you about.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Alright, so I suppose it's all my fault. So, three  cappuccino's one americano and four slices of lemon torte.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">(A little angry) NO!!! No lemon torte.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Oh yeh, you're right, it was them that wanted the lemon torte. They are difficult too, Changed the order when I served them. Decided they only wanted two slices.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Anton: So can we please have some coffee now.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Yes, yes, yes. Keep your hair on. It's on the way.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Thank goodness for that.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">This five pounds changing hands has reminded me of something.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">What's that Les?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">( a little laugh) Well I can't keep it either?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> I have just remembered that I owe Anton a fiver?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Do you?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">I do indeed<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> That five pound note will get worn out being passed around so much ( they all laugh at this).<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Why do you owe it to me Les?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Do you remember a few Sundays ago I was mowing my lawn and my mower ran out of petrol?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Oh yes! I remember now.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> I called you and asked if you had any and you brought me a can round.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">I normally have some in the garage.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Luckily for me.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> I didn't expect you to pay me for it though.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> Of course I would. It was just that I didn't have any cash in the house at the time. So here you are Anton, a fiver for the petrol<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton: </font color="#0000CC">There is really no need Anton.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Please take it. Petrol is not cheap these days.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Ok, thank you very much.<p>
 <font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> And thank you for enabling me to finish mowing my lawn.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Sorry, it seems we are sold out.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton, Kay Les and Bev together:</font color="#0000CC"> Sold out!!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> 'fraid so.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> How can you be sold out it's only 12.30 and this IS a coffee shop. How can you be sold out?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">This is getting ridiculous.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">It's no good moaning at me. I can't help it if we are sold out. Maybe we didn't get a delivery.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">A coffee shop that doesn't get a delivery of coffee? That's crazy.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Oh we've got plenty of coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">But you just said that you'd sold out.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">(tutting) Not sold out of coffee. We are a coffee shop, how can we sell out of coffee?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">That is exactly our point.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> But you did just say you were sold out.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Sold out of cheesecake, not coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton, Kay Les and Bev together:</font color="#0000CC"> CHEESCAKE!!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, someone had the last slice about twenty minutes ago.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> (Trying to keep cool. And speaking slowly) We never even thought of ordering cheesecake, we don't want cheesecake, in fact I may never eat cheesecake again, all we want are our coffee's.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Well when you sent the lemon torte back I thought you meant you wanted cheesecake instead.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">We didn't send the lemon torte back because we never ordered it in the first place and we definitely didn't want it replaced by cheesecake.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> You just can't please some people.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Can we please, please have some coffee. I am gasping here.<p>
<font color="#0000CC"> Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Me too<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">And me.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> So waiter, will you please take away the cheeescake and just bring us coffee?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">And please, just coffee. No tortes, no pies, no cookies just coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Ok, ok. People think working in a coffee shop is easy. If only they knew.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton: </font color="#0000CC">Now this is going to seem quite a coincidence.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">What is?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">It is concerning this five pound note.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">What about it?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Following a pattern here, it seems I can't keep it either?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Because I owe it to Bev<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev:</font color="#0000CC"> I am sure you don't<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Ahh but I am sure I do.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev:</font color="#0000CC"> Why?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Do you remember the last time we all met here Bev?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Yes, about a month ago wasn't it?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">Yes about then.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> I don't think I was here that time.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay:</font color="#0000CC"> No you were on vacation Les.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> Oh yes, that's right.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Well, on that day I had stupidly left my wallet in the car so Bev paid for my coffee.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev:</font color="#0000CC"> I don't even remember that. Anton please forget it. If one can't buy a coffee for a friend what a bad state we would be in.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> I agree Bev but as this fiver has been passed around the table and everyone has accepted it with grace it is only fair that you should too.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev: </font color="#0000CC">Well put like that how can I refuse. Thank you Anton.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">Great! Now we are all square, everyone has been paid back.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Here you are then. Four Coffee's. Three Cappuccino's and one Americano.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton, Kay Les and Bev together: </font color="#0000CC">Hooray!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Waiter:</font color="#0000CC"> Enjoy. I'll leave the bill on the table.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC"> Let me pass these around.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Kay: </font color="#0000CC">At last! I am ready for this.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Bev:</font color="#0000CC"> Me too.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les:</font color="#0000CC"> I thought I would never taste coffee again.<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">OH MY GOODNESS!!!<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Les: </font color="#0000CC">What's the matter Anton?<p>
<font color="#0000CC">Anton:</font color="#0000CC">Look at this bill!!! Eight coffee's, six slices of lemon torte, four cheesecakes and for some reason, two apple pies and custard.<p>
